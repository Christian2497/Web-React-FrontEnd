# Quick Compo

## Description

(app name) was born to help people stay fit when they can't or don't want to go out of home. 

## User Stories

- **404:** As an anon/user I can see a 404 page if I try to reach a page that does not exist so that I know it's my fault
- **Signup:** As an anon I can sign up in the platform so that I can join the fit community.
- **Login:** As a user I can login to the platform so that I can see the exercise routines.
- **Logout:** As a user I can logout from the platform when I finish using it.
